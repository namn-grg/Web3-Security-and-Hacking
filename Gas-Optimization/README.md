# IMPORTANT GAS OPTIMIZATION TIPS:-

1. It is better to declare function as external/ internal when it is. Pulic fns use more gas.

2. Using internal functions in the modifiers. Modifiers use the same stack space as a function (upto 16).

3. Using libraries is also very gas efficient. Eg. libraries from openzappelin do not add upto gas cost.

4. When using (||) or (&&) better to add terminate the statement as soon as possible. (T F F) is better than (F F T).

5. Use 'delete' keyword when you don't need a variable, this refunds the gas!!

6. Dont update the value of Storage variables often. Instead use temp variable and finally assign the value.

7. Make sure that the error strings in your require statements are of very short length, the more the length of the string, the more gas it will cost.

8. Fixed length variables are better than variable length.

9. Use the concept of variable packing ðŸš€.

10. Make your contract as specific as possible.

11. Using 'constant' keyword.
